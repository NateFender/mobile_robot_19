### Added
- Added follow_left() and follow_right() functions to straight_wall.py. follow_right() should be the same as before,
	but follow_left should follow the wall to the left of the robot. follow_left() needs to be tested.

### Changed
- Added boolean input to main() in wallDistance.py. This determines if the robot approaches the wall perpetually
	or if it stops after 60s and displays a plot of the distance over time.
- Changed straight_wall.py to now follow the closest wall to either the robot's left or right. Needs testing

## 2019-02-20
### Added
- Added wallDistance.py, which will be used for task 2
- Added tof_sensor_class.py, which initializes the tof sensors and includes some funtions for returning data
- Added robot_class.py, which will act as a wrapper class for all the components of the robot
- Added functions to return the max forward and backward speeds in inches to encoder_class.py

### Changed
- Reduced number of calibration tests
- Increased calibration time
- Calibration is now an average speed instead of intantaneous
